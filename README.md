# Real-time cumuliform fluid dynamics C++ simulator using recurrent neural networks 

This project simulates real-time 3D cumuli movement in an artificial intelligence fashion using recurrent neural networks (RNN) in GPGPU with C++, CUDA and PyTorch.

## Features

- Use of pseudo-spheroids
- Optimized noise structure
- Low number of pseudo-spheroids required
- Improved bounding boxes
- Improved Gaussian equations
- L-System fractal cloud generation
- Efficient lighting system with anisotropic forward scattering
- Fast light pre-calculation and occlusions thanks to the NDT algorithm
- Smooth 3D mesh clouds
- GPGPU cloud dynamics and morphing by using CUDA parallel programming
- Cumuliform fluid dynamics simulator using RNN with high performance
